The first thing I will do on this blog is justify its existence. An impetus! A motivation! A why!

Many reasons to blog, in no particular order:

I’ve always been a fan of lost internet media and niche blogs! Sometimes I like to search for random blogs and have a little taste of what I find, kind of like an omakase served by the internet. It is now my time to start slicing sashimi.

I'm no journalling fanatic, but I do like a good life archive. It keeps you accountable for your creations. I think that creation is one of the best ways to prove that you are alive. 

I'm also really an unreliable narrator when it comes to my own life, so I would like to have a tangible record to look back on in the future. 

Thoughts exist only in your head, but blogs exist on screens and in data warehouses. Much easier to access and query, more permanent albeit not nearly as eternal. 

I am in college now, which seems like exactly the right time for niche nerd projects. 

Tragically, I'm not taking a single humanities class this semester. I need to keep my creative skills sharp & juicy, like a pineapple. 

I want to take a creative writing minor, but I am a painfully slow writer & need to improve on that. I'm also honestly kind of a really bad writer from a certain angle, and I would like to get a look at myself from said angle to find out what's going on.

I have always thought that writing requires a certain kind of audacity, in a good way. Why would you write if you didn’t think you had anything to say?

I think it's pretty scary to show people what you create. It implicitly says that you think your creation is worth their time and their effort. Look at what I made! Look at how I think!

My experience in this world is worth just as much as anyone else’s. 

Everyone has a bit of a desire to be understood, and it is a desire that I would like to get better at expressing. All the things I say make no sense even to me, which is something I want to improve on.

It takes a lot of strength to translate your innards into out-ards. I think when you attempt to explain yourself to the world, you will begin to understand yourself a little better…
